        <h1>Nigerian Red Stew with Rice and Meat</h1>
        <p>Nigerian red stew is a flavorful 
        tomato-based sauce with a spicy kick. 
        To prepare, saut√© tomatoes, bell 
        peppers, onions, and spices until the 
        mixture thickens and the oil separates.
        Serve this rich stew over cooked rice 
        and your choice of meat, such as beef or
        chicken, for a delicious and satisfying 
        meal.</p>
