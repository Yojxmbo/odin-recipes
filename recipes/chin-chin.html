        <h1>Nigerian Chin Chin</h1>
        <p>Nigerian chin chin is a delightful 
        snack made by mixing flour, sugar, milk, 
        and optional flavorings into a stiff dough.
        Roll out the dough, cut it into small pieces, 
        and deep-fry until they turn golden brown.
        Drain on paper towels, and your crispy, 
        sweet chin chin is ready to enjoy!</p>
